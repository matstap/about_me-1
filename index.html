      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a burgeoning software developer currently currently enrolled in Code 201 at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.  Originally from Houston, Texas, I've lived all over the United States and even overseas India.  I consider myself to be well-traveled.
        Married, I'm also the co-creator of my son Sami.</p>

      <h2>Why Do I Want to Become a Developer?</h2>
      <p>Why Do I Want to Become a Software Developer?
It wasn't a quick, easy decision.  Having spent the last 14 years in Federal IT operations support (helpdesk) and security compliance, I decided I need something more creative.  I first heard about coding five years ago
through a friend of mine who was trying to convince me to get into the field. </p>
